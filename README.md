# TiledWithEmbed
This was designed as a simple demo showing the [go-tiled](https://github.com/lafriks/go-tiled) package being used with [ebitengine](https://ebitengine.org/).

This is the next step beyond https://github.com/shinjitsu/mapDemoEbitengineTiled since it used the go embed approach rather than just a bunch of files in the main directory.

I couldn't find any existing demos putting the two libraries together so feel free to point me at one if someone knows of one.
